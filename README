morelia-pcre is a Python binding for the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) library. It's created using Cython and it strives for completeness.

Why 'morelia-pcre'? Because 'python-pcre' was taken :-)

Testing:
./setup.py build_ext -i
./testsuite.py testdata/testinput1 testdata/testoutput1 | less

Code and issue tracker available at: https://github.com/stefantalpalaru/morelia-pcre
Tested with pcre-8.30 and python-2.7.3
