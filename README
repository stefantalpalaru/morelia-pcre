morelia-pcre is a set of Python bindings for the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) library. It's created using Cython and it strives for completeness.

Why 'morelia-pcre'? Because 'python-pcre' was taken :-)

Testing:
./setup.py build_ext -i
./test_re.py # 2 tests are known to fail with "maximum recursion limit exceeded"
./testsuite.py testdata/testinput1 testdata/testoutput1 | less
# during development:
./setup.py build_ext -i && { ./test_re.py; ./testsuite.py testdata/testinput1 testdata/testoutput1; }

Tested with pcre-8.35, cython-0.20.2 and python-2.7.8
